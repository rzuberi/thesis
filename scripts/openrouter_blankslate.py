INVENTORY = """DATA (all with appropriate approvals, oesophageal/gastric focus):
1. SWGCohort: 150 Barrett's oesophagus surveillance patients, 707 biopsy samples;
   H&E whole-slide images + shallow whole-genome sequencing (copy number) per
   sample; longitudinal follow-up with progression outcomes (HGD/cancer);
   pathologist grade per biopsy.
2. ERIN: 2,280 imaged oesophageal cases (H&E WSIs) from ~1,600 patients, each
   linked to its free-text pathology report (7,149 reports across the wider
   corpus); longitudinal (median span ~3.75 years, many patients with multiple
   timepoints); no structured labels beyond what can be extracted from text.
3. OCCAMS: 87-225 oesophageal adenocarcinoma resection cases; H&E WSIs + full
   WGS (TP53 status, ploidy, whole-genome doubling) + clinical outcome data
   (survival, stage, treatment).
4. TCGA-ESCA + TCGA-STAD: 446 cases with diagnostic WSIs, full multi-omics
   (mutations, CNV, expression), machine-readable pathology reports, and
   survival endpoints; 9,517 pan-cancer report+slide pairs available beyond GI.
5. Barrett's specialist database: 13,645 free-text pathology reports (no images
   for most), longitudinal per patient.

FEATURES ALREADY EXTRACTED: tile-level embeddings for all WSIs from five
pathology foundation models (UNI2-h, Virchow2, GigaPath, Phikon-v2,
H-Optimus-0).

COMPUTE: Slurm cluster with 16x NVIDIA H200 (141GB), 24x L40S (48GB), large
CPU partition; can run local LLMs up to ~120B (ollama) on-cluster; no
patient data may leave the cluster.

TOOLING THAT EXISTS: attention-based MIL training code (classification + Cox
survival), an 8-model local-LLM jury pipeline for extracting labels from
free-text reports, a rule-based report labeller."""
